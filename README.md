# Door Dash Delivery Time Prediction Project

**Question link:** [Delivery Duration Prediction](https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects/delivery-duration-prediction)

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the estimated delivery time for food orders placed by customers.

## Methodology
To achieve accurate predictions, this project leverages two powerful algorithms:
- **LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine):** A high-performance, gradient boosting framework that excels in handling large datasets with efficiency.
- **Linear Regression:** A fundamental regression algorithm used to model the relationship between variables.

## Performance Metric
The model is designed to minimize the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), ensuring accurate estimation of delivery times.
